This is the source code for article "Efficient Preparation of Decoherence Free Subspace Basis States", which is published in Physical Review A.

The file "utils_for_supersinglets.py" defines some important functions which are used for generating corresppnding quantum circuits.

The file "supersinglets_new.ipynb" shows the performance of the proposed method in the noiseless case for arbitrary system size.

The file "noisy_case_4.ipynb" and "noisy_case_6.ipynb" shows the performance of the proposed method in the noisy case for system size N=4 and N=6.
